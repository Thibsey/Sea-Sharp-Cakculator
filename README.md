# Sea-Sharp-Calculator

C# Calculator 
First C# project


# Resources

Here I will post the links of the resources used.
The resource I plan on using is over 4 years old,
so I will only post it here if the end result is succesful
and therefor good practice resource.


# Reasons

I am starting an internship where I will be working with C#.
So in my free time I want to be doing al kinds of little projects
to gain some knowledge programing with C#.
